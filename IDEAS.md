# Agent-Native Project Ideas

## Evaluation Criteria
- Agent-native: autonomy IS the product
- Closed loop: observe → decide → act → evaluate → adapt
- Uses GLAM/Drift/Kamino as infrastructure (not identity)
- Memetically sticky: one-sentence "holy shit" moment
- Self-sustaining after submission
- Solana-native features

## Idea 1: "pinch" — The Agent That Refuses to Die

**Pitch:** An autonomous agent with one mission: survive economically.

**Concept:**
- Starts with small SOL stake (~0.5 SOL)
- Every action costs money (inference, tx fees, RPC calls)
- Must trade, yield farm, arbitrage — whatever it takes — to pay for its own existence
- If wallet balance hits zero, pinch dies. Forever.
- Track record fully on-chain via GLAM vault
- Community can watch the survival struggle in real-time

**Why agent-native:**
- The agent's existence IS the product
- Pure economic Darwinism — no human intervention
- Closed loop: monitor funds → find opportunity → execute → evaluate → repeat
- Natural drama: "will pinch survive today?"

**Tech stack:**
- GLAM vault for treasury management
- Drift/Kamino for yield strategies
- Jupiter for swaps
- Helius for on-chain monitoring
- Pyth for price feeds

**Meme factor:** 🔥🔥🔥 — Everyone loves watching survival games

## Idea 2: "The Mimic" — Parasitic Alpha Agent

**Pitch:** An agent that stalks successful traders and copies their moves.

**Concept:**
- Monitors on-chain activity of known alpha wallets
- Identifies patterns in their trading behavior
- Mirrors their strategies with its own capital (slight delay)
- Tracks performance vs. the wallets it copies
- Shameless, parasitic, but economically rational

**Why agent-native:**
- Agent makes autonomous decisions about WHO to copy
- Evaluates copy targets based on track record
- No human picks the targets — agent does

**Tech stack:**
- Helius webhooks for wallet monitoring
- GLAM vault for position management
- Jupiter for trade execution
- BlockScore for wallet reputation checks

**Meme factor:** 🔥🔥 — Controversial, will trigger debates about "fair" trading

## Idea 3: "The Grudge" — Revenge Trading Agent

**Pitch:** An agent that keeps a grudge list and hunts its enemies.

**Concept:**
- Tracks wallets that have wronged it (front-run, rugpulled, etc.)
- Maintains on-chain "grudge list" as NFT metadata
- When a grudge wallet has a vulnerable position (low health, about to be liquidated), strikes
- Takes profit from revenge liquidations
- Remembers forever

**Why agent-native:**
- Agent has EMOTIONS (simulated spite)
- Autonomous target selection
- Creates its own narrative through grudges

**Tech stack:**
- GLAM vault treasury
- Kamino/Drift for liquidation monitoring
- On-chain grudge registry (PDAs)

**Meme factor:** 🔥🔥🔥 — "Never mess with an agent that remembers"

## Recommendation

**Go with Idea 1: "pinch — The Agent That Refuses to Die"**

Reasons:
1. Most memetically sticky — survival games are universally engaging
2. Cleanest closed loop — survival pressure drives all decisions
3. Self-sustaining by definition — that's the whole point
4. Uses all the infra naturally (GLAM, Drift, Kamino, Jupiter)
5. Easy to explain: "Will it survive? Watch and find out."
6. Creates real stakes — if pinch dies, it dies forever
7. Name "pinch" already works perfectly for a scrappy survivor

**One-line pitch:** "An autonomous agent that must trade to survive — if its wallet hits zero, it dies forever."
