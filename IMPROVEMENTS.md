# Level 5 — Technical Improvements & Roadmap

## Infrastructure
- [ ] **Mainnet RPC**: Switch to paid Helius/Triton RPC for reliability.
- [ ] **Key Management**: Move from local keypair files to Squads multisig or secure enclave.
- [ ] **Dashboard Hosting**: Deploy dashboard to Vercel/Railway instead of running on the agent node.

## Strategy
- [ ] **Yield Optimization**: Integrate Lulo for automated yield aggregation.
- [ ] **Risk Engine**: Implement real-time volatility monitoring (Risk Agent).
- [ ] **Swap Execution**: Add Jito bundles to prevent MEV/front-running.

## Agent Coordination
- [ ] **P2P Communication**: Enable direct negotiation with other hackathon agents (e.g., Pyxis, AgentBounty).
- [ ] **Memory**: Integrate AgentMemory for semantic search of past decisions.

## Compliance
- [ ] **Privacy**: Integrate Sipher for stealth execution.
- [ ] **Verifiable Logic**: Generate ZK proofs for risk compliance (Murkl/Succinct).
